I am a recording musician and software engineer.

🌱 Among other things, I am currently reading ["Data Science from Scratch"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)

🤔 And I’m looking for help with [my perl translation](https://github.com/ology/Data-Science-FromScratch) of sections of that book.
